	Contents of Dockerfile
	# Use the official NGINX image from the Docker Hub
	FROM nginx:latest

	# Copy custom HTML file to the container's default NGINX directory
	COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html

	# Expose port 80 to access the server
	EXPOSE 80

	# Start the NGINX server
	CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
	
	Contents of index.html
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	<head>
		<title>Welcome to My NGINX Server</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Hello, this is a simple NGINX server!</h1>
	</body>
	</html>

4)Run the below command to build a docker image

	docker build -t sample-image . 
	
	the above command will build the the image using dockerfile. The . indicates it will create the image at the same place using all files at the path and '-t' indicates the image name and in the above sample-image is the image name of the build.

5) Run the below command to run the image.

	docker run -it sample-image sh
	
	the above command runs the image named sample-image interactively i.e., you see the sh at end, it opens a cmd when it is run. other flags include -d for detached mode i.e., cmd can be closed after running the above command, -rm or --rm will run the image in a specific container and once container is closed it is autodeleted.
	
6) Once it is running correclty, you can push your docker image to hub to access it through internet in different systems.

	docker tag sample-image <usernameofdocker>/sample-image
	
	docker push <usernameofdocker>/sample-image
