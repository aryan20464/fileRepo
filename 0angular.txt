Kafka cluster
my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092
The bootstrap address of the Kafka cluster
Bridge nodes
1
The desired number of Kafka Bridge nodes.

http
The HTTP related configuration.

Resource Requirements
Limits describes the minimum/maximum amount of compute resources required/allowed
enableMetrics

enableMetrics
Enable the metrics for the Kafka Bridge. Default is false.

tracing
The configuration of tracing in Kafka Bridge.

readinessProbe
Pod readiness checking.
clientRackInitImage
The image of the init container used for initializing the `client.rack`.

livenessProbe
Pod liveness checking.

producer
Kafka producer related configuration.

consumer
Kafka consumer related configuration.

rack
Configuration of the node label which will be used as the client.rack consumer configuration.

authentication
Authentication configuration for connecting to the cluster.
type

scram-sha-512
Authentication type. Currently the supported types are `tls`, `scram-sha-256`, `scram-sha-512`, `plain`, and 'oauth'. `scram-sha-256` and `scram-sha-512` types use SASL SCRAM-SHA-256 and SASL SCRAM-SHA-512 Authentication, respectively. `plain` type uses SASL PLAIN Authentication. `oauth` type uses SASL OAUTHBEARER Authentication. The `tls` type uses TLS Client Authentication. The `tls` type is supported only over TLS connections.
enableMetrics

enableMetrics
Enable or disable OAuth metrics. Default value is `false`.
disableTlsHostnameVerification

disableTlsHostnameVerification
Enable or disable TLS hostname verification. Default value is `false`.
audience
OAuth audience to use when authenticating against the authorization server. Some authorization servers require the audience to be explicitly set. The possible values depend on how the authorization server is configured. By default, `audience` is not specified when performing the token endpoint request.
clientId
OAuth Client ID which the Kafka client can use to authenticate against the OAuth server and use the token endpoint URI.
accessTokenIsJwt

accessTokenIsJwt
Configure whether access token should be treated as JWT. This should be set to `false` if the authorization server returns opaque tokens. Defaults to `true`.
connectTimeoutSeconds
The connect timeout in seconds when connecting to authorization server. If not set, the effective connect timeout is 60 seconds.
accessTokenLocation
Path to the token file containing an access token to be used for authentication.

passwordSecret
Reference to the `Secret` which holds the password.
clientAssertionLocation
Path to the file containing the client assertion to be used for authentication.
clientAssertionType
The client assertion type. If not set, and either `clientAssertion` or `clientAssertionLocation` is configured, this value defaults to `urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer`.
readTimeoutSeconds
The read timeout in seconds when connecting to authorization server. If not set, the effective read timeout is 60 seconds.
scope
OAuth scope to use when authenticating against the authorization server. Some authorization servers require this to be set. The possible values depend on how authorization server is configured. By default `scope` is not specified when doing the token endpoint request.

accessToken
Link to Kubernetes Secret containing the access token which was obtained from the authorization server.
username
Username used for the authentication.
maxTokenExpirySeconds
Set or limit time-to-live of the access tokens to the specified number of seconds. This should be set if the authorization server returns opaque tokens.

clientAssertion
Link to Kubernetes secret containing the client assertion which was manually configured for the client.

clientSecret
Link to Kubernetes Secret containing the OAuth client secret which the Kafka client can use to authenticate against the OAuth server and use the token endpoint URI.
httpRetryPauseMs
The pause to take before retrying a failed HTTP request. If not set, the default is to not pause at all but to immediately repeat a request.
includeAcceptHeader

includeAcceptHeader
Whether the Accept header should be set in requests to the authorization servers. The default value is `true`.
httpRetries
The maximum number of retries to attempt if an initial HTTP request fails. If not set, the default is to not attempt any retries.

certificateAndKey
Reference to the `Secret` which holds the certificate and private key pair.

template
Template for Kafka Bridge resources. The template allows users to specify how a `Deployment` and `Pod` is generated.
